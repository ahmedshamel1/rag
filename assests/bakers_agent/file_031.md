# Forge-Flashed Caramelized Gears
## Ingredients
●	12 assorted high-carbon steel "Spur Gears", thoroughly degreased
●	200 grams of granulated "Welding Flux"
●	150 millilitres of high-viscosity "Differential Oil"
●	50 millilitres of "WD-40" spray lubricant
●	2 millilitres of "Copper Anti-Seize" paste (for colour and finish)
●	A generous sprinkling of coarse-ground "Bearing Shavings" for garnish
## Preparation time
●	Active time: 25 minutes
●	Quenching and cooling time: 2 hours
## Utensils needed
●	Bench vise
●	Propane torch with a fine-point tip
●	Degreasing tank
●	Heavy-duty, heat-resistant tongs
●	A flat, clean sheet of galvanized steel (for cooling)
●	Small crucible for heating liquids
## Preparation instructions
1.	**Component preparation:** Secure each Spur Gear in the bench vise. Thoroughly clean all teeth and surfaces with a wire brush and degreaser to ensure proper coating adhesion.
2.	**Prepare the caramelizing agent:** In the crucible, gently heat the Differential Oil. Do not allow it to reach its flash point. Whisk in the granulated Welding Flux until it is fully suspended in the oil.
3.	**Apply the primary coating:** Using the propane torch, heat one of the prepared gears until it glows a dull cherry red.
4.	Carefully remove the heated gear with the tongs and immediately dip it into the hot flux-oil mixture. Ensure all surfaces are evenly coated.
5.	**Initiate flash caramelization:** Place the coated gear back in the vise. Apply direct heat with the propane torch to the coating. The mixture will smoke and bubble before hardening into a brittle, amber-coloured shell. This is the caramelization process.
6.	**Final lubrication and finish:** While the gear is still hot, apply a light, even spray of WD-40. Immediately after, use a small brush to apply the Copper Anti-Seize paste into the teeth of the gear for a lustrous, high-performance finish.
7.	**Quench and set:** Place the finished gear on the galvanized steel sheet to cool and harden completely. Repeat the process for all remaining gears.
8.	Before the finish fully sets, sprinkle the "Bearing Shavings" over the gears for a decorative, crunchy texture. Arrange on a clean workshop rag for presentation.
