# Peach Tarte Tatin
## Ingredients
- 	1 sheet of ready-made all-butter puff pastry (approximately 320-375 grams)
-	4-5 large, ripe but firm peaches
-	100 grams unsalted butter
-	150 grams caster sugar
-	1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
## Preparation time
-	Active time: 20 minutes
-	Inactive time (baking): 30-35 minutes
## Utensils needed
-	23-25 centimetre heavy-bottomed, oven-safe skillet or frying pan
-	Sharp knife
-	Cutting board
-	Rolling pin (if needed to adjust pastry size)
-	Serving plate larger than the skillet
## Preparation instructions
1.	**Prepare the peaches**: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Score a small 'X' at the bottom of each peach. Blanch the peaches in the boiling water for 30-60 seconds, then immediately transfer them to a bowl of ice water. The skins should peel off easily. Halve the peaches and remove the stones.
2.	**Preheat the oven**: Preheat your oven to 200C (180C Fan).
3.	**Make the caramel**: In the oven-safe skillet, melt the butter over a medium heat. Stir in the caster sugar until it is evenly moistened. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture turns into a rich, amber-coloured caramel. This should take about 5-8 minutes. Be careful not to let it burn.
4.	**Remove the skillet** from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract, if using.
5.	**Arrange the peaches**: Carefully arrange the peach halves, cut-side up, in a single, tightly packed layer over the caramel in the skillet.
6.	**Add the pastry**: If your pastry sheet is not round, lightly roll it into a circle slightly larger than your skillet. Drape the pastry over the peaches in the skillet. Carefully tuck the edges of the pastry down the inside of the pan, enclosing the peaches.
7.	Prick the top of the pastry a few times with a knife to allow steam to escape.
8.	**Bake**: Place the skillet in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed up, golden-brown, and crisp.
9.	**Rest and invert**: Carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Let the tarte tatin rest in the pan for 2-3 minutes; this allows the caramel to cool slightly but not completely set.
10.	Place a large serving plate over the skillet. With oven mitts on, quickly and carefully flip the skillet over to invert the tarte tatin onto the plate. Lift the skillet away. If any peaches stick to the pan, simply lift them out and place them back on the tart. Serve warm, on its own or with vanilla ice cream.
