●	50 grams plain flour
●	A pinch of salt
●	Icing sugar, for dusting (optional)
Preparation time
●	Active time: 20 minutes
●	Inactive time (baking): 12-15 minutes
Utensils needed

●	Pastry brush
●	Heatproof bowl
●	Small saucepan
●	Electric mixer or whisk
●	Spatula
●	Sieve
Preparation instructions
1.	Prepare oven and ramekins: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Thoroughly grease the inside of four individual ramekins with butter. For extra non-stick security, you can lightly dust the inside with flour or cocoa powder, tapping out any excess.
2.	Melt chocolate and butter: Place the chopped white chocolate and cubed butter into a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water. Ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir gently until both are melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3.	Whip eggs and sugar: In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the whole eggs, egg yolks, and caster sugar together for several minutes. Continue until the mixture is thick, pale, and has significantly increased in volume.
4.	Combine mixtures: Gently pour the lukewarm white chocolate and butter mixture into the whipped egg mixture. Using a spatula, carefully fold them together until just combined, being careful not to knock out too much air.
5.	Fold in dry ingredients: Sift the plain flour and the pinch of salt over the mixture. Gently fold the flour in until no streaks remain. Do not overmix.
6.	Fill and bake: Carefully divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking tray.
7.	Bake for 12-15 minutes. The edges of the coulants should be set and firm, but the centre should still have a distinct wobble. The baking time is critical for achieving the molten centre.
8.	Serve immediately: Let the coulants rest for one minute before carefully running a knife around the edge of each ramekin. Invert each one onto a serving plate. Dust with icing sugar, if desired, and serve immediately.
