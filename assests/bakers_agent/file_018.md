## Preparation instructions
1.	**Make the pastry**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs1 with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining. If using a food processor, pulse until this consistency is reached.
2.	**Gradually add the ice-cold water**, mixing with a fork or pulsing until the dough just begins to come together. Do not overwork it.
3.	**Divide the dough** into two discs, one slightly larger than the other. Wrap both in cling film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
4.	**Prepare the filling**: In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples with the lemon juice. In a separate small bowl, mix together the caster sugar, 30g of plain flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Pour this over the apples and toss gently to coat them evenly.
5.	**Assemble the pie**: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). On a lightly floured surface, roll out the larger disc of pastry into a circle large enough to line the base and sides of your pie dish. Carefully place the pastry in the dish.
6.	**Spoon the apple filling** into the pastry-lined dish, mounding it slightly in the centre. Dot the top of the filling with the small pieces of butter.
7.	Roll out the smaller disc of pastry to form the lid. Drape it over the filling. Trim the edges of both pastry layers, leaving a small overhang. Press the edges together to seal, then crimp them with your fingers or a fork.
8.	Cut several slits in the top of the pie to allow steam to escape. If using, brush the top of the pie with the egg wash.
9.	**Bake the pie**: Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake for 15 minutes at 200°C, then reduce the oven temperature to 180°C (160°C Fan) and continue to bake for another 40-50 minutes, or until the crust is deep golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
10.	Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing to allow the filling to set.
