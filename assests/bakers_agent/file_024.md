# Lime Panna Cotta
## Ingredients
●	500 millilitres double cream (heavy cream)
●	100 grams caster sugar
●	Zest of 2 large limes
●	60 millilitres fresh lime juice (from approx. 2-3 limes)
●	3 sheets of gelatine (or 1.5 teaspoons powdered gelatine)
●	Optional: extra lime zest or thin lime slices for garnish
## Preparation time
●	Active time: 15 minutes
●	Inactive time (chilling): 4-6 hours
## Utensils needed
●	Small bowl
●	Medium saucepan
●	Whisk
●	Fine-mesh sieve
●	4-6 ramekins or serving glasses (approx. 150ml capacity)
## Preparation instructions
1.	**Prepare the gelatine**: If using gelatine sheets, place them in a small bowl of cold water to soften for 5-10 minutes. If using powdered gelatine, sprinkle it over 3 tablespoons of cold water in a small bowl and let it bloom for 5-10 minutes.
2.	**Heat the cream**: In a medium saucepan, combine the double cream, caster sugar, and the zest of 2 limes. Heat the mixture over a medium-low heat, stirring gently until the sugar has completely dissolved. Do not let the mixture boil.
3.	**Dissolve the gelatine**: Remove the saucepan from the heat. Squeeze the excess water from the softened gelatine sheets and add them to the hot cream mixture, whisking until fully dissolved. If using bloomed powdered gelatine, add it to the hot cream and whisk until smooth and completely dissolved.
4.	**Add the lime juice**: Stir the fresh lime juice into the cream mixture.
5.	**Strain and pour**: Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a jug to remove the lime zest and ensure a smooth consistency.
6.	Divide the panna cotta mixture evenly among your chosen ramekins or serving glasses.
7.	**Chill**: Place the panna cottas in the refrigerator to chill and set for at least 4 hours, or until completely firm.
8.	**Serve**: Garnish with extra lime zest or a thin slice of lime just before serving. If you wish to unmould the panna cottas, dip the bottom of each ramekin in hot water for a few seconds before inverting onto a serving plate.
