Preparation instructions
1.	Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C Fan). Grease the square baking tin and line it with baking paper.
2.	Place the butter and dark chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water. Ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally until both are melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
3.	In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the eggs and caster sugar together for several minutes until the mixture is thick, pale, and has doubled in volume.
4.	Gently pour the cooled chocolate-butter mixture over the egg and sugar mixture. Using a spatula, carefully fold everything together until just combined. Be careful not to knock out too much air.
5.	Sift the plain flour, cocoa powder, and salt directly into the bowl. Fold these dry ingredients in until no streaks of flour are visible. Do not overmix.
6.	Pour the brownie batter into the prepared tin and level the top with the spatula.
7.	Bake for 25-30 minutes. The top should have a shiny, papery crust and the middle should be slightly gooey. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out with moist crumbs attached, but not wet batter.
8.	Allow the brownies to cool completely in the tin before lifting them out and cutting them into squares.
