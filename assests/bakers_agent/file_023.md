## Preparation instructions
1.	Make the raspberry coulis: In a small saucepan, combine the fresh raspberries, 1 tablespoon of caster sugar, and 1 tablespoon of water. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes until the raspberries have broken down completely.
2.	Push the cooked raspberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl to remove the seeds. Set the smooth coulis aside to cool completely.
3.	Melt the white chocolate: Place the finely chopped white chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, heat 100 millilitres of the double cream until it is steaming and just beginning to simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Let it sit for one minute, then stir gently until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.
4.	Prepare the mousse base: In a separate medium bowl, whisk the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of caster sugar together until pale and slightly thickened.
5.	Gently fold the cooled melted white chocolate mixture into the egg yolk mixture until just combined.
6.	Whip the cream: In another clean bowl, whip the remaining 150 millilitres of cold double cream until it holds soft peaks.
7.	Combine for the mousse: Take one large spoonful of the whipped cream and fold it into the white chocolate mixture to lighten it. Then, gently fold in the rest of the whipped cream in two additions until the mousse is smooth and evenly combined. Be careful not to overmix and knock out the air.
8.	Assemble the desserts: Take your serving glasses. Spoon a layer of the cooled raspberry coulis into the bottom of each glass.
9.	Carefully spoon or pipe the white chocolate mousse on top of the coulis layer, dividing it evenly among the glasses.
10.	Chill: Place the mousses in the refrigerator to chill and set for at least 4 hours, or until firm.
11.	Before serving, decorate with fresh raspberries and white chocolate shavings, if desired.
