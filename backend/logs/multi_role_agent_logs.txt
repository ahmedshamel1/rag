  Chunk 1: Preparation instructions 
1. Make the pastry: In a food processor, pulse the flour and butter until the mixture 
resembles breadcrumbs. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour in a large 
bowl. Stir in the icing sugar. Add the egg yolk and cold water, and mix until the
dough just comes together. Form it into a disc, wrap it in cling film, and chill in the 
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Blind bake the crust: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Lightly flour a 
work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it is large enough to line the tart 
tin. Press the pastry into the tin, trimming any excess. Prick the base with a fork. 
Line the pastry case with baking paper and fill with baking beans or uncooked 
rice. Bake for 15 minutes. 
3. Remove the paper and beans, then bake for another 5-10 minutes until the 
pastry is pale golden and cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly. 
4. Prepare the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C (150°C Fan). In a 
medium bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and caster sugar. 
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the double cream, whole eggs, and extra egg yolks 
together. Pour the cream and egg mixture into the lemon and sugar mixture, 
whisking until well combined. 
6. Bake the pie: Pour the filling through a sieve directly into the prepared pastry 
case. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is just set with a slight wobble in 
the centre. 
7. Allow the pie to cool completely in the tin before removing and slicing. It will firm 
up as it cools.

  Chunk 3: Preparation instructions 
1. Make the pastry: In a food processor, pulse the flour and butter until the mixture 
resembles breadcrumbs. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour in a large 
bowl. Stir in the icing sugar. Add the egg yolk and cold water, and mix until the
dough just comes together. Form it into a disc, wrap it in cling film, and chill in the 
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Blind bake the crust: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Lightly flour a 
work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it is large enough to line the tart 
tin. Press the pastry into the tin, trimming any excess. Prick the base with a fork. 
Line the pastry case with baking paper and fill with baking beans or uncooked 
rice. Bake for 15 minutes. 
3. Remove the paper and beans, then bake for another 5-10 minutes until the 
pastry is pale golden and cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly. 
4. Prepare the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C (150°C Fan). In a 
medium bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and caster sugar. 
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the double cream, whole eggs, and extra egg yolks 
together. Pour the cream and egg mixture into the lemon and sugar mixture, 
whisking until well combined. 
6. Bake the pie: Pour the filling through a sieve directly into the prepared pastry 
case. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is just set with a slight wobble in 
the centre. 
7. Allow the pie to cool completely in the tin before removing and slicing. It will firm 
up as it cools.
