  Chunk 3: Preparation instructions
1.	Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C Fan). Grease the square baking tin and line it with baking paper.
2.	Place the butter and dark chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water. Ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir occasionally until both are melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.
3.	In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the eggs and caster sugar together for several minutes until the mixture is thick, pale, and has doubled in volume.
4.	Gently pour the cooled chocolate-butter mixture over the egg and sugar mixture. Using a spatula, carefully fold everything together until just combined. Be careful not to knock out too much air.
5.	Sift the plain flour, cocoa powder, and salt directly into the bowl. Fold these dry ingredients in until no streaks of flour are visible. Do not overmix.
6.	Pour the brownie batter into the prepared tin and level the top with the spatula.
7.	Bake for 25-30 minutes. The top should have a shiny, papery crust and the middle should be slightly gooey. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out with moist crumbs attached, but not wet batter.
8.	Allow the brownies to cool completely in the tin before lifting them out and cutting them into squares.

  Chunk 4: Preparation instructions
1.	Prepare oven and ramekins: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Thoroughly grease the inside of four individual ramekins with butter. For extra non-stick security, you can lightly dust the inside with flour or cocoa powder, tapping out any excess.
2.	Melt chocolate and butter: Place the chopped white chocolate and cubed butter into a heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water. Ensure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir gently until both are melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3.	Whip eggs and sugar: In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the whole eggs, egg yolks, and caster sugar together for several minutes. Continue until the mixture is thick, pale, and has significantly increased in volume.
4.	Combine mixtures: Gently pour the lukewarm white chocolate and butter mixture into the whipped egg mixture. Using a spatula, carefully fold them together until just combined, being careful not to knock out too much air.
5.	Fold in dry ingredients: Sift the plain flour and the pinch of salt over the mixture. Gently fold the flour in until no streaks remain. Do not overmix.
6.	Fill and bake: Carefully divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins. Place the ramekins on a baking tray.
7.	Bake for 12-15 minutes. The edges of the coulants should be set and firm, but the centre should still have a distinct wobble. The baking time is critical for achieving the molten centre.
8.	Serve immediately: Let the coulants rest for one minute before carefully running a knife around the edge of each ramekin. Invert each one onto a serving plate. Dust with icing sugar, if desired, and serve immediately.

  Chunk 5: Preparation instructions
1. Prepare the crunchy pistachio filling: If the kataifi pastry is in a block, use your 
hands to separate and fluff the strands. Use scissors or a knife to chop them into 
smaller pieces (about 1-2 cm). 
2. Melt 30 grams of butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped 
kataifi and toast, stirring frequently, until it is golden brown and crispy all over. 
This may take 8-10 minutes. 
3. Transfer the toasted kataifi to a bowl. Add the pistachio paste and optional tahini. 
Mix until all the kataifi strands are evenly coated. Set aside to cool completely. 
4. Once cool, roll the filling into small balls, about 15 grams each (or about 2 
teaspoons). Place them on a plate lined with baking paper and freeze for at least 
30 minutes until firm. 
5. Make the cookie dough: In a large bowl, cream the softened 175 grams of 
butter with the light brown sugar and caster sugar using an electric mixer until 
light and fluffy. 
6. Beat in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until well combined. 
7. In a separate bowl, sift together the plain flour, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. 
8. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on a low speed 
until just combined. Do not overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips. 
9. Assemble the cookies: Take a portion of cookie dough (about 50-60 grams, or 
a large ice cream scoop's worth) and flatten it in the palm of your hand. 
10. Place one of the frozen pistachio filling balls in the centre. Carefully wrap the 
cookie dough around the filling, ensuring it is completely sealed. Roll it into a 
smooth ball. 
11. Place the cookie dough balls on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Chill in 
the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. 
12. Bake the cookies: Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C Fan). Arrange the chilled 
cookie dough balls on a baking sheet, leaving ample space between them to 
spread. 
13. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centres are 
still soft. 
14. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them 
to a wire rack to cool further. They are best served warm.

  Chunk 1: Allergen information 
● Contains: Milk, Eggs.
Crème Brûlée 
Ingredients 
● 500 millilitres double cream (heavy cream, at least 40% fat) 
● 1 vanilla pod or 1 teaspoon high-quality vanilla extract 
● 5 large egg yolks 
● 100 grams caster sugar, plus extra for caramelising 
● A pinch of salt 
Preparation time 
● Active time: 20 minutes 
● Inactive time (baking and chilling): 3 hours 30 minutes 
Utensils needed 
● Medium saucepan 
● Whisk 
● Mixing bowl 
● Fine-mesh sieve 
● 4-6 shallow, round ramekins (approx. 150ml capacity) 
● Deep roasting tin or baking dish 
● Kitchen blow torch 
Preparation instructions 
1. Preheat oven and prepare ingredients: Preheat your oven to 160°C (140°C 
Fan). 
2. Infuse the cream: Pour the double cream into a medium saucepan. If using a 
vanilla pod, split it lengthwise, scrape out the seeds with the back of a knife, and 
add both the pod and the seeds to the cream. If using vanilla extract, you will add 
it later. 
3. Heat the cream over a medium-low heat until it is steaming and small bubbles 
appear around the edge. Do not let it boil. Remove from the heat and let the 
vanilla infuse for 15 minutes. 
4. Prepare the custard base: In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks, 100 grams of 
caster sugar, and the pinch of salt together until the mixture is pale and has 
thickened slightly. 
5. Combine the mixtures: Slowly pour the warm cream into the egg yolk mixture, 
whisking continuously to temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling. If 
you used a vanilla pod, remove it now. If using vanilla extract, stir it in.
6. Strain the custard: Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a jug to 
remove any lumps and ensure a silky-smooth texture. 
7. Bake the custards: Arrange the ramekins in the deep roasting tin. Pour the 
custard mixture evenly among the ramekins. Carefully pour hot water into the 
roasting tin until it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins (this is called a 
bain-marie or water bath). 
8. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the custards are just set but still have a slight 
wobble in the centre. 
9. Chill: Carefully remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to 
room temperature. Then, transfer them to the refrigerator and chill for at least1 3 
hours, or preferably overnight, until completely firm. 
10. Caramelise and serve: Just before serving, sprinkle an even, thin layer of caster 
sugar (about 1-2 teaspoons) over the top of each chilled custard. Using a kitchen 
blow torch, melt the sugar until it forms a crisp, golden-brown caramel crust. Let it 
sit for a minute to harden before serving immediately.
