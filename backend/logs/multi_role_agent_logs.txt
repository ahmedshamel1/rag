  Chunk 3: Preparation instructions

Pour the milk and cream into a medium saucepan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into the pan and add the pod itself. Heat the mixture over a medium heat until it is steaming and small bubbles form around the edge. Do not allow it to boil. Remove from the heat and allow the vanilla to infuse for 30 minutes.

In a separate heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar together until the mixture is pale and has thickened.

Remove the vanilla pod from the milk mixture. Slowly pour the warm milk mixture onto the egg and sugar mixture, whisking continuously to temper the eggs and prevent scrambling.

Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over a low-medium heat, stirring constantly with the spatula, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of the spatula. This will take approximately 8-10 minutes. Do not let it boil. If using vanilla extract instead of a pod, stir it in now.

Strain the finished custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to ensure it is smooth.

Cover the surface of the custard directly with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming and cool it completely in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.

Once thoroughly chilled, churn the custard in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions until it reaches a soft-serve consistency.

Transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container,1 cover, and freeze for at least 2-4 hours, or until firm.

  Chunk 7: Preparation instructions 
1. Make the pastry: In a food processor, pulse the flour and butter until the mixture 
resembles breadcrumbs. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour in a large 
bowl. Stir in the icing sugar. Add the egg yolk and cold water, and mix until the
dough just comes together. Form it into a disc, wrap it in cling film, and chill in the 
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Blind bake the crust: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Lightly flour a 
work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it is large enough to line the tart 
tin. Press the pastry into the tin, trimming any excess. Prick the base with a fork. 
Line the pastry case with baking paper and fill with baking beans or uncooked 
rice. Bake for 15 minutes. 
3. Remove the paper and beans, then bake for another 5-10 minutes until the 
pastry is pale golden and cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly. 
4. Prepare the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C (150°C Fan). In a 
medium bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and caster sugar. 
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the double cream, whole eggs, and extra egg yolks 
together. Pour the cream and egg mixture into the lemon and sugar mixture, 
whisking until well combined. 
6. Bake the pie: Pour the filling through a sieve directly into the prepared pastry 
case. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is just set with a slight wobble in 
the centre. 
7. Allow the pie to cool completely in the tin before removing and slicing. It will firm 
up as it cools.
