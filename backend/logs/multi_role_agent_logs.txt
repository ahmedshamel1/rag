  Chunk 1: Preparation instructions

Place the strawberries, cold milk, vanilla ice cream, and optional sugar and vanilla extract into the blender jug.

Secure the lid on the blender.

Blend on a high speed for 30-60 seconds, or until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

If the milkshake is too thick, add a small splash of extra milk and blend again briefly until it reaches your desired consistency.

Pour the milkshake into serving glasses immediately.
