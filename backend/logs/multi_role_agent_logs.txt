● Contains: Milk, Eggs.
Crème Brûlée 
Ingredients 
● 500 millilitres double cream (heavy cream, at least 40% fat) 
● 1 vanilla pod or 1 teaspoon high-quality vanilla extract 
● 5 large egg yolks 
● 100 grams caster sugar, plus extra for caramelising 
● A pinch of salt 
Preparation time 
● Active time: 20 minutes 
● Inactive time (baking and chilling): 3 hours 30 minutes 
Utensils needed 
● Medium saucepan 
● Whisk 
● Mixing bowl 
● Fine-mesh sieve 
● 4-6 shallow, round ramekins (approx. 150ml capacity) 
● Deep roasting tin or baking dish 
● Kitchen blow torch 
Preparation instructions 
1. Preheat oven and prepare ingredients: Preheat your oven to 160°C (140°C 
Fan). 
2. Infuse the cream: Pour the double cream into a medium saucepan. If using a 
vanilla pod, split it lengthwise, scrape out the seeds with the back of a knife, and 
add both the pod and the seeds to the cream. If using vanilla extract, you will add 
it later. 
3. Heat the cream over a medium-low heat until it is steaming and small bubbles 
appear around the edge. Do not let it boil. Remove from the heat and let the 
vanilla infuse for 15 minutes. 
4. Prepare the custard base: In a mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks, 100 grams of 
caster sugar, and the pinch of salt together until the mixture is pale and has 
thickened slightly. 
5. Combine the mixtures: Slowly pour the warm cream into the egg yolk mixture, 
whisking continuously to temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling. If 
you used a vanilla pod, remove it now. If using vanilla extract, stir it in.
6. Strain the custard: Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a jug to 
remove any lumps and ensure a silky-smooth texture. 
7. Bake the custards: Arrange the ramekins in the deep roasting tin. Pour the 
custard mixture evenly among the ramekins. Carefully pour hot water into the 
roasting tin until it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins (this is called a 
bain-marie or water bath). 
8. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the custards are just set but still have a slight 
wobble in the centre. 
9. Chill: Carefully remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to 
room temperature. Then, transfer them to the refrigerator and chill for at least1 3 
hours, or preferably overnight, until completely firm. 
10. Caramelise and serve: Just before serving, sprinkle an even, thin layer of caster 
sugar (about 1-2 teaspoons) over the top of each chilled custard. Using a kitchen 
blow torch, melt the sugar until it forms a crisp, golden-brown caramel crust. Let it 
sit for a minute to harden before serving immediately.

  Chunk 2: Preparation instructions 
1. Prepare the base and tin: Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C Fan). Grease the 
base and sides of the springform tin and line the base with baking paper. 
2. Crush the digestive biscuits to a fine crumb using a food processor. Mix the 
crumbs with the melted butter and the pinch of salt until fully combined. Press 
this mixture firmly into the base of the prepared tin. Bake for 10 minutes. Set 
aside to cool. 
3. Prepare the Gamonéu curd: In a small saucepan, gently heat the double cream 
and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Do not boil. Place the crumbled Gamonéu 
cheese in a small bowl and pour the hot cream over it. Let it sit for 5 minutes, 
then whisk vigorously until you have a relatively smooth, thick paste. Push the 
mixture through a sieve to remove any lumps and set aside. 
4. Reduce the oven temperature to 160°C (140°C Fan). 
5. Make the cheesecake filling: In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the room-
temperature cream cheese on a low speed until completely smooth and free of 
lumps. 
6. Add the caster sugar and beat until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the 
bowl. 
7. In a separate small bowl, whisk the crème fraîche with the white miso paste until 
smooth. Add this to the cream cheese mixture along with the vanilla extract and 
lemon zest. Beat on low speed until just incorporated. 
8. Add the eggs and the extra egg yolk one at a time, mixing on a low speed after 
each addition until just combined. Do not overmix, as this incorporates too much 
air. 
9. Finally, fold in the sifted plain flour with a spatula. 
10. Assemble and bake: Pour three-quarters of the cheesecake filling over the 
cooled biscuit base. Dollop small spoonfuls of the Gamonéu curd over the 
surface. Pour the remaining cheesecake filling on top. Use a skewer to gently 
swirl the curd through the top layer of the filling once or twice. 
11. Place the tin in the large roasting tin. Pour boiling water into the roasting tin to 
come halfway up the sides of the cake tin (this is a bain-marie or water bath). 
12. Bake for 60-70 minutes. The edges of the cheesecake should be set, but the 
centre should still have a distinct wobble. 
13. Cool the cheesecake: Turn off the oven, prop the oven door open slightly, and 
let the cheesecake cool completely inside the oven for at least 2 hours. This 
gradual cooling process is crucial to prevent cracking. 
14. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and let it cool to room temperature 
on a wire rack. Then, cover it with cling film and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or 
preferably overnight, before releasing from the tin and serving.

  Chunk 1: Preparation instructions 
1. Make the pastry: In a food processor, pulse the flour and butter until the mixture 
resembles breadcrumbs. If making by hand, rub the butter into the flour in a large 
bowl. Stir in the icing sugar. Add the egg yolk and cold water, and mix until the
dough just comes together. Form it into a disc, wrap it in cling film, and chill in the 
refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 
2. Blind bake the crust: Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C Fan). Lightly flour a 
work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it is large enough to line the tart 
tin. Press the pastry into the tin, trimming any excess. Prick the base with a fork. 
Line the pastry case with baking paper and fill with baking beans or uncooked 
rice. Bake for 15 minutes. 
3. Remove the paper and beans, then bake for another 5-10 minutes until the 
pastry is pale golden and cooked through. Set aside to cool slightly. 
4. Prepare the filling: Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C (150°C Fan). In a 
medium bowl, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and caster sugar. 
5. In a separate bowl, whisk the double cream, whole eggs, and extra egg yolks 
together. Pour the cream and egg mixture into the lemon and sugar mixture, 
whisking until well combined. 
6. Bake the pie: Pour the filling through a sieve directly into the prepared pastry 
case. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the filling is just set with a slight wobble in 
the centre. 
7. Allow the pie to cool completely in the tin before removing and slicing. It will firm 
up as it cools.
