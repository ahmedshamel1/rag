2.2 Hand Hygiene Protocol 
Handwashing is the single most important action an employee can take to prevent food 
contamination. Designated handwashing sinks, equipped with hot water, liquid soap, and single-
use paper towels, are to be used for handwashing only. Sinks used for food preparation or 
equipment washing must never be used for washing hands. 
The Mandatory 7-Step Handwashing Procedure: 
1. Wet Hands: Wet hands thoroughly with clean, running hot water (as hot as can be

washed away. 
5. Dry: Dry hands completely using a single-use paper towel. 
6. Turn off Tap: Use the paper towel to turn off the tap to avoid re-contaminating hands. 
7. Dispose: Dispose of the paper towel in a foot-operated bin. 
When to Wash Hands (Mandatory): 
● Upon entering the kitchen and before starting work. 
● Immediately before handling any ready-to-eat food. 
● Immediately after handling raw ingredients (e.g., flour, eggs, unwashed fruit). 
● After using the toilet.

comfortably tolerated). 
2. Apply Soap: Apply a sufficient amount of liquid antibacterial soap to create a good 
lather. 
3. Lather and Scrub (20 seconds): Vigorously rub hands together for at least 20 seconds. 
This is the critical step. Ensure all surfaces are scrubbed, including: 
○ Back of hands 
○ Wrists 
○ Between fingers 
○ Under fingernails (scrub fingertips against palms) 
○ Thumbs 
4. Rinse: Rinse hands thoroughly under clean, running water, ensuring all soap residue is

kitchen, we primarily use chemical sanitizers. 
5.2 Six-Step Cleaning and Sanitizing Procedure

  Chunk 5:
2. Main Clean (Wash): Wash the surface thoroughly with hot water and the approved 
food-safe detergent. Use a clean, designated cloth, brush, or scourer. Apply vigorous 
scrubbing to dislodge all adhered food residue and grease. For complex equipment like 
mixers, this may involve disassembly to clean individual parts. 
3. First Rinse: Rinse the surface completely with clean, hot water to remove all traces of

label. If it is a certified "no-rinse" sanitizer, this step can be omitted, which is often 
preferred to avoid potential re-contamination from the rinse water. 
6. Air Dry: Allow the surface or equipment to air dry completely. Do not use a cloth or tea 
towel to dry it. Re-used cloths are a major source of cross-contamination and will 
reintroduce bacteria to the freshly sanitized surface. Store freshly cleaned items upside 
down on a clean rack to allow for drainage and drying.

  Chunk 7:
This detailed procedure must be followed methodically for all food contact surfaces 
(workbenches, tables), equipment (mixers, slicers), and utensils (knives, bowls, spatulas). 
1. Pre-Clean (Scrape): Before introducing water, remove all loose and large food debris 
from the surface. Scrape them directly into a designated waste bin. This step makes the 
washing process more effective and keeps the wash water cleaner for longer.
