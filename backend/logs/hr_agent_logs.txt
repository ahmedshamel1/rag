  Chunk 1:
check should confirm the mixture has visibly 
thickened and coats the back of a spoon 
without running. 
Cheesecakes (Baked) 70°C Reaching this temperature ensures that the 
egg proteins have fully coagulated, which sets 
the structure of the cheesecake and ensures it 
is pasteurized and safe to eat. The centre 
should be just set with a slight wobble. 
Quiches & Savoury 
Pies with Egg 
74°C This ensures that all ingredients, including the 
egg and dairy filling, are safely cooked through

  Chunk 2:
items like savoury pastries, pies, or hot dessert sauces may require reheating or hot holding for 
service. These processes also have critical temperature requirements to ensure safety. 
Reheating Procedure: 
● Objective: The goal of reheating is to move the food through the Temperature Danger 
Zone as quickly as possible to prevent the regrowth of any bacteria. 
● Critical Limit: When reheating a previously cooked and cooled high-risk food, its core

  Chunk 3:
moves the food through the most dangerous part of the temperature range where 
bacteria multiply fastest. 
● Stage 2: From 20°C down to 5°C or below within the next 4 hours. Once the food is 
out of the highest-risk temperature range, this second stage ensures it is brought to a 
safe refrigeration temperature. 
The total maximum time for the entire cooling process is 6 hours. 
Approved Rapid Cooling Methods: Simply placing a large, hot pot of custard directly into a

  Chunk 4:
may have survived the cooking process to germinate and multiply to dangerous levels. Rapid 
cooling is therefore a critical control point. 
The Mandatory Two-Stage Cooling Process: This process is a legal requirement and must be 
strictly followed for cooling all high-risk cooked foods, such as custards, pastry creams, and 
savoury fillings. 
● Stage 1: From 60°C down to 20°C within 2 hours. This is the most critical phase, as it

  Chunk 5:
● Fresh cream, whipped cream, and cream cheese frostings. 
● Any product containing dairy and eggs. 
Rules of the Danger Zone: 
● Cold foods must be held at 5°C or colder. 
● Hot foods must be held at 60°C or hotter. 
● The 2-Hour/4-Hour Rule: This rule applies to high-risk foods that need to be at room 
temperature for preparation or service. 
○ 0-2 Hours: Food can be used, or returned to the refrigerator (below 5°C) for later 
use.

  Chunk 6:
seconds before recording it. 
● Record the Temperature: All critical temperature checks must be logged in the 
appropriate record book with the time, date, and initials of the person checking. 
4.3 Critical Cooking and Baking Temperatures 
Cooking and baking are the most effective Critical Control Points (CCPs) for eliminating 
biological hazards. Reaching a specific internal temperature for a sufficient amount of time is the

  Chunk 7:
periodically to verify the concentration of sanitizing solutions. 
○ Required Contact Time: The sanitizer needs time to work. The required contact 
time (e.g., 30-60 seconds) will be stated on the product label and must be 
adhered to. Wiping the sanitizer off immediately will render it useless. 
5. Final Rinse (If required): Some chemical sanitizers require a final rinse with clean, 
potable water to remove any chemical residue that could taint food. Check the product

User Query: what are the utensils needed

  2. what are the utensils needed
  3. I can only provide guidance on HR and workplace-related matters. The question about utensils needed to make a lemon pie is not related to HR policies or procedures. However, I can suggest that you refer to the kitchen's standard operating procedures or recipe guidelines for specific information on utensils required for making a lemon pie.

If you have any HR-related questions or concerns, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you.

  Chunk 1:
This detailed procedure must be followed methodically for all food contact surfaces 
(workbenches, tables), equipment (mixers, slicers), and utensils (knives, bowls, spatulas). 
1. Pre-Clean (Scrape): Before introducing water, remove all loose and large food debris 
from the surface. Scrape them directly into a designated waste bin. This step makes the 
washing process more effective and keeps the wash water cleaner for longer.

  Chunk 2:
cannot be effective without the other. Both are required for all food contact surfaces to ensure a 
safe environment. 
● Cleaning: This is the physical process of removing visible matter. It involves using 
detergent, hot water, and physical friction (scrubbing with a cloth or brush) to remove 
food debris, dirt, grease, and other residues. Cleaning is what makes a surface look 
clean. It is the essential first step, but it does not effectively kill pathogenic bacteria or 
viruses.

  Chunk 3:
food product frequently with a clean, sanitized utensil to bring the hotter liquid from the 
centre to the colder edges, which dramatically speeds up the cooling process. 
3. Ice Wands/Paddles: These are purpose-made, food-safe plastic paddles that are filled 
with water and frozen. They can be stirred directly into large pots of liquids to cool the 
product from the inside out, working in conjunction with an ice bath for maximum

  Chunk 4:
Implementation: 
● A chart displaying the colour-coding system will be prominently posted in the kitchen. 
● All staff must be trained on the system and its importance. 
● Cutting boards and knife handles corresponding to these colours will be used exclusively 
for their designated food type. 
● Mixing these items is a serious breach of food safety protocol. For example, a green 
board used for chopping strawberries must never be used to slice a finished cake.

  Chunk 5:
● People-to-Food: When unwashed hands transfer pathogens to food after touching a 
contaminated surface or raw ingredient. 
● Equipment-to-Food: When contaminated utensils, cutting boards, or surfaces are used 
for RTE food without being properly cleaned and sanitized. 
Preventing cross-contamination is a non-negotiable aspect of our daily operations. 
3.2 Segregation of Raw and Ready-to-Eat (RTE) Foods 
A physical separation must be maintained between raw materials and RTE products at all

  Chunk 6:
○ Cosmetics: The use of heavy makeup, perfume, and aftershave is discouraged 
as strong scents can be absorbed by food products, particularly those with high 
fat content like butter and cream. 
● Disposable Gloves: 
○ Gloves are not a substitute for handwashing. Hands must be washed before 
putting on gloves and after removing them. 
○ Gloves must be changed frequently: 
■ If they become torn or soiled. 
■ After handling raw ingredients and before touching ready-to-eat food.

  Chunk 7:
To provide a clear, visual aid in preventing cross-contamination, this kitchen will implement a 
mandatory colour-coding system for cutting boards, knives, and other transferable equipment. 
● Green: For fresh fruits and vegetables. 
● Yellow: For cooked products. 
● Red: For raw meats (if ever used for specialty savoury items).  
● White: For bakery and dairy products (e.g., bread, cheese). 
● Blue: For raw fish (if ever used).
