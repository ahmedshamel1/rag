  Chunk 1: food product frequently with a clean, sanitized utensil to bring the hotter liquid from the 
centre to the colder edges, which dramatically speeds up the cooling process. 
3. Ice Wands/Paddles: These are purpose-made, food-safe plastic paddles that are filled 
with water and frozen. They can be stirred directly into large pots of liquids to cool the 
product from the inside out, working in conjunction with an ice bath for maximum

  Chunk 2: for the kitchen. 
○ Use a CO2 or Dry Powder (ABC) fire extinguisher. 
● Gas Shut-Off: The emergency gas shut-off valve is located on the back wall of the 
kitchen, marked with a large red handle. In the event of a kitchen fire, the Head Chef or 
designated safety lead should shut this off only if it is safe to approach. 
● Using a Fire Extinguisher: Remember the P.A.S.S. acronym: 
○ P - PULL the pin. 
○ A - AIM the nozzle at the base of the fire. 
○ S - SQUEEZE the lever slowly and evenly.

  Chunk 3: This detailed procedure must be followed methodically for all food contact surfaces 
(workbenches, tables), equipment (mixers, slicers), and utensils (knives, bowls, spatulas). 
1. Pre-Clean (Scrape): Before introducing water, remove all loose and large food debris 
from the surface. Scrape them directly into a designated waste bin. This step makes the 
washing process more effective and keeps the wash water cleaner for longer.

  Chunk 4: Implementation: 
● A chart displaying the colour-coding system will be prominently posted in the kitchen. 
● All staff must be trained on the system and its importance. 
● Cutting boards and knife handles corresponding to these colours will be used exclusively 
for their designated food type. 
● Mixing these items is a serious breach of food safety protocol. For example, a green 
board used for chopping strawberries must never be used to slice a finished cake.

● Red: For raw meats (if ever used for specialty savoury items).  
● White: For bakery and dairy products (e.g., bread, cheese). 
● Blue: For raw fish (if ever used).

  Chunk 6: check should confirm the mixture has visibly 
thickened and coats the back of a spoon 
without running. 
Cheesecakes (Baked) 70°C Reaching this temperature ensures that the 
egg proteins have fully coagulated, which sets 
the structure of the cheesecake and ensures it 
is pasteurized and safe to eat. The centre 
should be just set with a slight wobble. 
Quiches & Savoury 
Pies with Egg 
74°C This ensures that all ingredients, including the 
egg and dairy filling, are safely cooked through

  Chunk 7: large batches of hot liquids (like crème anglaise or pastry cream) into multiple smaller, 
shallow pans (e.g., stainless steel hotel pans). A larger surface area allows heat to 
dissipate much more rapidly into the surrounding air. 
2. Ice Bath: This method actively draws heat out of the product. Place the shallow pan of 
hot food into a larger container (or a clean, sanitized sink) filled with a mixture of ice and
