  Chunk 1: 2.2 Hand Hygiene Protocol 
Handwashing is the single most important action an employee can take to prevent food 
contamination. Designated handwashing sinks, equipped with hot water, liquid soap, and single-
use paper towels, are to be used for handwashing only. Sinks used for food preparation or 
equipment washing must never be used for washing hands. 
The Mandatory 7-Step Handwashing Procedure: 
1. Wet Hands: Wet hands thoroughly with clean, running hot water (as hot as can be

  Chunk 2: washed away. 
5. Dry: Dry hands completely using a single-use paper towel. 
6. Turn off Tap: Use the paper towel to turn off the tap to avoid re-contaminating hands. 
7. Dispose: Dispose of the paper towel in a foot-operated bin. 
When to Wash Hands (Mandatory): 
● Upon entering the kitchen and before starting work. 
● Immediately before handling any ready-to-eat food. 
● Immediately after handling raw ingredients (e.g., flour, eggs, unwashed fruit). 
● After using the toilet.

2. Apply Soap: Apply a sufficient amount of liquid antibacterial soap to create a good 
lather. 
3. Lather and Scrub (20 seconds): Vigorously rub hands together for at least 20 seconds. 
This is the critical step. Ensure all surfaces are scrubbed, including: 
○ Back of hands 
○ Wrists 
○ Between fingers 
○ Under fingernails (scrub fingertips against palms) 
○ Thumbs 
4. Rinse: Rinse hands thoroughly under clean, running water, ensuring all soap residue is 
washed away.

food-safe detergent. Use a clean, designated cloth, brush, or scourer. Apply vigorous 
scrubbing to dislodge all adhered food residue and grease. For complex equipment like 
mixers, this may involve disassembly to clean individual parts.

  Chunk 6: This detailed procedure must be followed methodically for all food contact surfaces 
(workbenches, tables), equipment (mixers, slicers), and utensils (knives, bowls, spatulas). 
1. Pre-Clean (Scrape): Before introducing water, remove all loose and large food debris 
from the surface. Scrape them directly into a designated waste bin. This step makes the 
washing process more effective and keeps the wash water cleaner for longer.

preferred to avoid potential re-contamination from the rinse water. 
6. Air Dry: Allow the surface or equipment to air dry completely. Do not use a cloth or tea 
towel to dry it. Re-used cloths are a major source of cross-contamination and will 
reintroduce bacteria to the freshly sanitized surface. Store freshly cleaned items upside 
down on a clean rack to allow for drainage and drying.
